        In order to learn more about functional programming and specifically the Elm language, I decided to implement the game Connect-4 in it.

        title="Connect-4 & Checkers"
        img="./assets/angular-connect-4.png"

        tech-stack="typescript, angular"
      >
        To see if I could make the implementation more optimal, I then implemented Connect-4 in Angular as well. And then I generalized the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Minimax</a> algorithm from Connect-4 and reused it to implement Checkers in the same project.

      >
        A simple game for Samsung smartwatches, the goal is to navigate your rocket through a maze. On the watch, steering is done by turning the watch's bezel, but since it's written in HTML and JS, it can also be played in the browser using the keys A, W and D.

        A little block building game made with a combination of 3D CSS transformations and Webcomponents. Each item in the game is a Webcomponent: The 3D scene, the floor, the blocks and the color picker. Place new blocks using left-click, remove them using right-click, you can move around using W,A,S,D,Q and Z/Y keys and change the camera angle using the arrow keys.
