    <h1>Working with image files and clipboard items in Javascript</h1>
    <p>
      The following are some very simple Javascript code examples, detailing 4 basic image operations.
      These are useful specifically if we are making an app that does some kind of image manipulation in the client,
      either through the Canvas API, or through the direct manipulation of individual pixels.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="./upload-image/upload-image.html">Load an image from a file</a>: The user uploads an image file into
        the
        app, where it gets loaded into memory and
        analyzed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="./paste-image/paste-image.html">Paste image data from the clipboard</a>: The same as the previous
        example, but here the image data is read from the
        system clipboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="./copy-image/copy-image.html">Copy image data to the clipboard</a>: Copy image to the clipboard: Draws
        an image using the
        Canvas API and then copies it to the system clipboard (<a
          href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-api_clipboard_write">This unfortunately does not work on Firefox yet</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="./download-image/download-image.html">Save an image to a file</a>: Draws an image using the Canvas API
        and then
        downloads it
      </li>
    </ul>
